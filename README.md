# Masters-Project


"Project Main" is the primary code base used to solve the scalar field equation for the STFQ model, and derive some interesting quantities.

The "Initial Conditions Generator STFQ" will generate the initial conditions that are used in the main code from whatever input parameters you have. This has been folded into the "Project Main", but it may be useful to quickly generate some numbers.

"bug location file" is my testing file that I use for finding and removing bugs. I'll generally copy large chunks of the main code in here then rewrite it until I find the bug, then implements those changes back in the main file.
